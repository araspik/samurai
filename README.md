# `smake`: A Simple/SDLang Make program
A Make program designed for SDLang-formatted Makefiles.

Hopefully my first actually complete project.

### Rust?
I am trying out Rust, and I'd like to see if it could improve the code I have
here. As such, this is a new branch I've made where I will try out Rust,
file-by-file, on the whole project (there's not that much). If it works out,
I'll switch completely to Rust, and if not, I'll continue using D.
